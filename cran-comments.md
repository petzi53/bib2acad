## 3rd Resubmission

The program writes now .md and .bib files into folders in tempdir()
again checked with local OS X and win-builder

## Resubmission
This is my second resubmission.

I have deleted in the description the (wrong) reference to a top level folder.

This is a resubmission. 

I have changed the Authors@R field to a call to person()
